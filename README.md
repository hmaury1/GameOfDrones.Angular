# GameOfDroneAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.1.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you've installed recent versions of Node.js in your machine. To test your machine versions, execute node -v and npm -v.

2. Run npm install -g @angular/cli. This command will install the latest version of Angular command line interface (CLI) globally.

3. Navigate to the project’s root directory.

4. Run npm install. This command will install all the project dependencies (as mentioned, it will create the “node_modules” folder) listed in the “package.json” file.

5. modify the src/config.json to configure the correct API URL, for Example: "api_url": "http://localhost:49815/"

6. Run ng serve -o  using the console. Hopefully, this task will be executed correctly and you won’t encounter any errors. If errors do occur, make sure that steps 1 and 2 have been completed successfully.

7. Open your browser and type http://localhost:4200.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
